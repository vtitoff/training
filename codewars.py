def partitions(n):
    '''define a function which returns the number of integer partitions of n'''



print(partitions(5)) #7
#
# For example, there are 7 integer partitions of 5:
#
# [5], [4,1], [3,2], [3,1,1], [2,2,1], [2,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1].
# Write a function which returns the number of integer partitions of n.
# The function should be able to find the number of integer partitions of n for n at least as large as 100.
